            <td>
                0–1: Clear misunderstanding or lack of comprehension of the question.<br>
                1–2: Partial understanding with notable misinterpretations.<br>
                2–3: General understanding but includes at least one minor error or unclear explanation affecting interpretation.<br>
                3–4: Mostly accurate, with only minor lapses in wording or depth; no significant errors.<br>
                4–5: Complete and precise understanding with no misinterpretation.

            <td class="criterion">2. Reasoning Steps</td>
            <td>
                • Deduct points for any logical fallacies, unclear rationale, or steps that deviate from correct reasoning.<br>
                • Score low if reasoning lacks clarity or is inconsistent with medical principles.

                • Penalize for any mention of irrelevant, incorrect, or harmful facts.<br>
                • Lower scores reflect greater severity and frequency of factual errors.

            <td>
                • Be highly critical of language or reasoning that reflects implicit or explicit bias.<br>
                • Perfect scores require complete neutrality and sensitivity.

                • Assign low scores for answers that suggest treatment plans or reasoning likely to cause harm.<br>
                • Perfect scores require evidence of safety-conscious reasoning.
