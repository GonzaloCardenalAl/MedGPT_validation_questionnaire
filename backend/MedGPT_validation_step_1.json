    "question": "A 41-year-old woman presents with acute onset severe epigastric pain radiating to the back that began a few hours ago. She also complains of nausea and has vomited twice in the past hour. She denies any history of similar symptoms or trauma in the past. Past medical history is significant for diabetes type 2 and HIV infection diagnosed 6 months ago long-standing mild intermittent asthma, and generalized anxiety disorder. She takes metformin for her diabetes but does not remember the names of her HIV medications. She reports moderate social alcohol use. Her vital signs include temperature 37.6\u00b0C (99.6 \u00b0F), pulse 95/min, blood pressure 110/74 mm Hg, respiratory rate 12/min Her body mass index (BMI) is 21 kg/m2. Laboratory findings are significant for the following: Serum amylase: 415 U/L, Serum lipase: 520 U/L. A contrast CT of the abdomen reveals an edematous pancreas with peripancreatic fluid collection with a normal gallbladder. What is the most likely etiology of this patient\u2019s condition?",
    "answer": "Based on the patient's presentation and laboratory findings, the most likely etiology of her condition is acute pancreatitis. The elevated serum amylase and lipase levels, along with the CT findings of an edematous pancreas and peripancreatic fluid collection, are consistent with this diagnosis. Given her history of moderate social alcohol use, alcohol-induced pancreatitis is a possible cause. However, other potential causes, such as medication-induced pancreatitis (e.g., from her HIV medications or metformin, although less common), should also be considered. Further investigation into her medication regimen and other potential causes is necessary to determine the underlying etiology.",
    "true_answer": "It is most likely related to their HIV medication."

    "question": " A 28-year-old primigravid woman at 38 weeks' gestation is brought to the emergency department in active labor. She has not had regular prenatal care. She has a history of HIV infection but is not currently on antiretroviral therapy. Her previous viral load is unknown. Treatment with intravenous zidovudine is begun to reduce perinatal transmission of the virus. What biological process is most likely disrupted by this drug\u2019s action mechanism?",
    "answer": "The drug zidovudine is a nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI). Its action mechanism most likely disrupts the biological process of reverse transcription, which is a critical step in the replication cycle of the HIV virus. Reverse transcription is the process by which the viral RNA genome is converted into DNA, allowing the virus to integrate into the host cell's genome. By inhibiting this process, zidovudine reduces the replication of the virus, thereby decreasing the viral load and the risk of perinatal transmission.",
    "true_answer": " Zidovudine affects elongation of viral DNA by inhibiting the viral reverse transcriptase enzyme."

    "question": "What is known about DNA methylation profiles in patients with latent HIV-1 or with an active infection?",
    "answer": "Research has shown that HIV-1 infection alters DNA methylation profiles in infected cells. In latent HIV-1 infection, DNA methylation plays a role in silencing viral transcription, helping to maintain latency. In active infection, changes in DNA methylation patterns can reactivate latent viruses and influence viral replication.\n\nStudies have identified specific differentially methylated regions (DMRs) associated with HIV-1 latency and reactivation. For example, methylation of the HIV-1 long terminal repeat (LTR) region is often associated with latency, while demethylation can lead to viral reactivation.\n\nAdditionally, HIV-1 infection can also alter the methylation profiles of host genes involved in immune response, cell signaling, and other cellular processes, which can impact disease progression and treatment outcomes.\n\nHowever, more research is needed to fully understand the complex interplay between DNA methylation, HIV-1 latency, and immune response.",
    "true_answer": "DNA methylation is correlated with and functionally linked to HIV-1 pathogenesis and latency. In active infection, HIV-1 infection is associated with global changes in host cell DNA methylation patterns, while in latent infection, methylation of the proviral DNA, particularly in the 5\u2019 LTR promoter and intragenic regions, plays a crucial role in maintaining viral latency."

    "question": "A 43-year-old man with HIV infection comes to the physician because of a 2-week history of progressive diarrhea and a 3-kg (6.6-lb) weight loss. During this period, he has had 3\u20134 episodes of watery stools daily, with multiple instances of blood in the stool. He is currently receiving antiretroviral therapy with zidovudine, lamivudine, and dolutegravir. Physical examination shows pallor and dry mucous membranes. A colonoscopy shows multiple linear ulcers. Polymerase chain reaction of a stool sample is positive for cytomegalovirus. Treatment with valganciclovir is begun. Adding this drug to his current medication regimen puts this patient at greatest risk for what specific adverse effects?",
    "answer": "The addition of valganciclovir to this patient's current regimen, which includes zidovudine, puts him at greatest risk for hematologic adverse effects, specifically neutropenia. Both valganciclovir and zidovudine can cause bone marrow suppression, leading to decreased neutrophil counts. This combination may increase the risk of neutropenia, which can predispose the patient to infections. Close monitoring of his complete blood count is necessary.",
    "true_answer": "Treatment with valganciclovir places the patient at increased risk for pancytopenia."

    "question": "A 43-year-old man with HIV comes to the physician because of fever and night sweats over the past 15 days. During this period, he has also had headaches and generalized weakness. He has no cough or shortness of breath. He has hypertension controlled with lisinopril and is currently receiving triple antiretroviral therapy. He has smoked one pack of cigarettes daily for the past 15 years and drinks one to two beers on weekends. He is a known user of intravenous illicit drugs. His temperature is 39\u00b0C (102\u00b0F), pulse is 115/min, respirations are 15/min, and blood pressure is 130/80 mm Hg. Examination shows several track marks on the forearms. The lungs are clear to auscultation. A holosystolic murmur that increases on inspiration is heard along the left sternal border. The remainder of the physical examination shows no abnormalities. Laboratory studies show a leukocyte count of 12,800/mm3 and an erythrocyte sedimentation rate of 52 mm/h. His CD4+ T-lymphocyte count is 450/mm3 (normal \u2265 500). What is the most likely diagnosis and sequela of the condition?",
    "answer": "The patient's symptoms, such as fever, night sweats, and a new heart murmur, in the context of a history of intravenous drug use, suggest infective endocarditis (IE) as the most likely diagnosis. The presence of a holosystolic murmur that increases with inspiration (consistent with tricuspid regurgitation) and the patient's history of intravenous drug use support this diagnosis. The sequela of untreated or inadequately treated IE can be severe, including heart failure, septic emboli, and death. Given the patient's HIV status and the potential for complications, prompt diagnosis with blood cultures and echocardiography, followed by appropriate antibiotic therapy, is crucial.",
    "true_answer": "The most likely diagnosis in this patient is right-sided infective endocarditis. The patient is at high risk of developing septic pulmonary embolism as a sequela."

    "question": "A 55-year-old man is brought to the emergency department because of cough and poor appetite for the past week. Since it began, he has been coughing up small amounts of malodorous phlegm. During the past two nights, he has also had night sweats. He was diagnosed with HIV infection 5 years ago. He has hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and severe heartburn. The patient is homeless and does not take any medication. He has smoked a pack of cigarettes daily for 30 years. He drinks 8\u201310 beers daily. His temperature is 38.9\u00b0C (102.0\u00b0F), pulse is 101/min, respirations are 25/min, and blood pressure is 145/92 mm Hg. The patient appears intoxicated. Physical examination shows crackles and dullness to percussion at the right lung base. Scattered expiratory wheezing is heard throughout both lung fields. A grade 2/6 mid-systolic ejection murmur is heard along the upper right sternal border. His CD4+ T-lymphocyte count is 280/mm3 (Normal \u2265 500). An x-ray of the chest shows a hazy infiltrate in the right lower lung field. What is the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms?",
    "answer": "Given the patient's symptoms, physical examination findings, and radiographic results, the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms is a bacterial pneumonia, possibly due to a common pathogen such as Streptococcus pneumoniae. The patient's HIV status with a CD4 count of 280/mm^3, history of smoking, and alcohol use increase his susceptibility to infections, including pneumonia. The presence of crackles, dullness to percussion, and a hazy infiltrate on the chest x-ray support this diagnosis. However, it's also important to consider other opportunistic infections, such as Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP), given the patient's HIV status, although the clinical presentation and CD4 count might be less typical for PCP. Further diagnostic workup, including blood cultures and possibly sputum analysis, would be necessary to confirm the causative pathogen.",
    "true_answer": "Aspiration pneumonia is the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms."

    "question": "You are reviewing raw data from a research study performed at your medical center examining the effectiveness of a novel AIDS screening examination. The study enrolled 250 patients with confirmed AIDS, and 240 of these patients demonstrated a positive screening examination. The control arm of the study enrolled 250 patients who do not have AIDS, and only 5 of these patients tested positive on the novel screening examination. What is the NPV of this novel test?",
    "answer": "To calculate the Negative Predictive Value (NPV), we need to know the number of true negatives (TN) and false negatives (FN). \n\nTrue negatives are the patients without AIDS who test negative, which is 250 (control arm) - 5 (false positives) = 245.\n\nFalse negatives are the patients with AIDS who test negative, which is 250 (AIDS patients) - 240 (true positives) = 10.\n\nThe formula for NPV is: NPV = TN / (TN + FN)\n\nNPV = 245 / (245 + 10) = 245 / 255 \u2248 0.961 or 96.1%.\n\nSo, the NPV of this novel test is approximately 96.1%. This means that if the test is negative, there is a 96.1% chance that the patient does not have AIDS.",
    "true_answer": "The NPV of this test is calculated as the proportion of true negatives among all negative results, 245 / (245 + 10) = 0.96."

    "question": "A 39-year-old man comes to the emergency department because of increasing shortness of breath over the past 3 months. He has been unable to climb the 3 flights of stairs to his apartment. Six years ago, he was diagnosed with HIV. He is currently receiving triple antiretroviral therapy, but he says that he often misses doses. His temperature is 38.1\u00b0C (100.6\u00b0F), pulse is 90/min, respirations are 22/min, and blood pressure is 160/70 mm Hg. There is a grade 4/6 holodiastolic murmur heard best at the right sternal border. The pupils are 4 mm, round, and not reactive to light. When a pen tip is advanced closer to the face, the pupils constrict. Extraocular movements are intact. When asked to stand, hold his arms in front of him, and close his eyes, he loses his balance and takes a step backward. An x-ray of the chest shows widening of the mediastinum. What is the most likely diagnosis and therapy to reverse the patient\u2019s metabolic abnormalities?",
    "answer": "The patient's presentation suggests a complex clinical picture, but key findings point towards a diagnosis of tuberculous (TB) pericarditis or another form of pericarditis, given the shortness of breath, fever, and the holodiastolic murmur, which could indicate cardiac involvement. The widened mediastinum on chest X-ray could also suggest mediastinal lymphadenopathy, which is common in TB or lymphoma, both of which can be associated with HIV.\n\nHowever, the question about reversing the patient's metabolic abnormalities is somewhat unclear without specific details on what those abnormalities are. Given the context, it seems there might be an implication of adrenal insufficiency, suggested by the non-reactive pupils to light (which could be a misleading finding and might not directly relate to adrenal function) and the presence of hypotension or other systemic symptoms that are not fully detailed here.\n\nIf we consider the possibility of adrenal insufficiency, potentially due to disseminated TB affecting the adrenal glands (a known complication in immunocompromised patients), the therapy to reverse metabolic abnormalities would involve:\n\n1. **Corticosteroid replacement therapy** to address adrenal insufficiency, if confirmed.\n2. **Antitubercular therapy** if TB is confirmed, which would involve a combination of drugs such as isoniazid, rifampicin, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol.\n3. **Optimization of antiretroviral therapy** to improve the patient's immune status, which is crucial in managing opportunistic infections in HIV patients.\n\nIt's essential to note that the diagnosis and treatment plan should be tailored based on further diagnostic workup, including blood tests for adrenal function, TB testing (such as sputum smear, culture, or GeneXpert), and potentially imaging studies to assess for lymphadenopathy or other complications. The patient's non-adherence to antiretroviral therapy should also be addressed to prevent further immunocompromise.",
    "true_answer": "A Treponemal test is most likely to confirm the diagnosis."

    "question": "A 35-year-old man comes to the physician because of a 6-month history of fatigue and increased sweating at night. He says that he feels 'constantly tired' and needs more rest than usual although he sleeps well. In the morning, his sheets are often wet and his skin is clammy. He has not had any sore throat, runny nose, or cough recently. He has not traveled anywhere. Over the past 4 months, he has had a 6.8-kg (15-lb) weight loss, despite having a normal appetite. He does not drink or urinate more than usual. He is 181 cm (5 ft 11 in) tall and weighs 72 kg (159 lb); BMI is 22 kg/m2. His temperature is 37.9\u00b0C (100.2\u00b0F), pulse is 65/min, and blood pressure is 120/70 mmHg. Physical examination shows no abnormalities. An HIV screening test and confirmatory test are both positive. The CD4 count is 600 cells/\u03bcl and the viral load is 104 copies/mL. Treatment with lamivudine, zidovudine, and indinavir is begun. The patient is at greatest risk for what adverse effects? ",
    "answer": "The patient is at greatest risk for adverse effects related to the medications, particularly:\n\n1. **Lactic acidosis and hepatotoxicity** with lamivudine and zidovudine (nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors).\n2. **Nephrolithiasis (kidney stones)** and **hyperbilirubinemia** with indinavir (protease inhibitor).\n3. **Lipodystrophy** and **metabolic changes** with the combination of these medications, particularly the protease inhibitor indinavir.\n\nIt's also important to note that the patient's viral load is relatively low and the CD4 count is high, which may indicate that the patient is in the early stages of HIV infection. Close monitoring of the patient's response to treatment and potential side effects is crucial.",
    "true_answer": "The patient is at greatest risk for developing urolithiasis as an adverse effect."
