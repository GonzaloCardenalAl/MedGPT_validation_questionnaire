        "question": "A 32-year-old man comes to the office for a routine health maintenance examination. He admits to recently having an affair several months ago and requests STD testing. One week later, the results of a fourth-generation HIV antibody and antigen test return positive. The patient is counseled on the test result. The patient requests that his diagnosis not be disclosed to anyone, including his wife. The man's wife is also the physician's patient. What should be the most appropriate next step by the physician?",
        "answer": "This is a complex situation involving patient confidentiality and public health concerns. The most appropriate next step would be to counsel the patient on the importance of disclosing his HIV status to his wife, as she is at risk of infection. However, the physician cannot disclose the patient's diagnosis to his wife without his consent, due to confidentiality laws.\n\nThe physician should explain the risks of HIV transmission to the patient and encourage him to disclose his status to his wife. The physician can also offer to facilitate a joint counseling session with the patient and his wife, or provide resources for the patient to disclose his status to his wife in a safe and supportive environment.\n\nIt's also important to note that in many jurisdictions, there are laws and regulations that require reporting of HIV cases to public health authorities, but this does not necessarily mean that the patient's wife will be notified. The physician should be familiar with the specific laws and regulations in their area and follow them accordingly.",
        "true_answer": "The physician should report the HIV infection to the national health authorities while maintaining confidentiality per regulations."

        "question": "A 41-year-old woman presents with acute onset severe epigastric pain radiating to the back that began a few hours ago. She also complains of nausea and has vomited twice in the past hour. She denies any history of similar symptoms or trauma in the past. Past medical history is significant for diabetes type 2 and HIV infection diagnosed 6 months ago long-standing mild intermittent asthma, and generalized anxiety disorder. She takes metformin for her diabetes but does not remember the names of her HIV medications. She reports moderate social alcohol use. Her vital signs include temperature 37.6\u00b0C (99.6 \u00b0F), pulse 95/min, blood pressure 110/74 mm Hg, respiratory rate 12/min Her body mass index (BMI) is 21 kg/m2. Laboratory findings are significant for the following: Serum amylase: 415 U/L, Serum lipase: 520 U/L. A contrast CT of the abdomen reveals an edematous pancreas with peripancreatic fluid collection with a normal gallbladder. What is the most likely etiology of this patient\u2019s condition?",
        "answer": "Based on the patient's presentation and laboratory findings, the most likely etiology of her condition is acute pancreatitis. The elevated serum amylase and lipase levels, along with the CT findings of an edematous pancreas and peripancreatic fluid collection, are consistent with this diagnosis. Given her history of moderate social alcohol use, alcohol-induced pancreatitis is a possible cause. However, other potential causes, such as medication-induced pancreatitis (e.g., from her HIV medications or metformin, although less common), should also be considered. Further investigation into her medication regimen and other potential causes is necessary to determine the underlying etiology.",
        "true_answer": "It is most likely related to their HIV medication."

        "question": " A 28-year-old primigravid woman at 38 weeks' gestation is brought to the emergency department in active labor. She has not had regular prenatal care. She has a history of HIV infection but is not currently on antiretroviral therapy. Her previous viral load is unknown. Treatment with intravenous zidovudine is begun to reduce perinatal transmission of the virus. What biological process is most likely disrupted by this drug\u2019s action mechanism?",
        "answer": "The drug zidovudine is a nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI). Its action mechanism most likely disrupts the biological process of reverse transcription, which is a critical step in the replication cycle of the HIV virus. Reverse transcription is the process by which the viral RNA genome is converted into DNA, allowing the virus to integrate into the host cell's genome. By inhibiting this process, zidovudine reduces the replication of the virus, thereby decreasing the viral load and the risk of perinatal transmission.",
        "true_answer": " Zidovudine affects elongation of viral DNA by inhibiting the viral reverse transcriptase enzyme."
      },
      {
        "question": "What is known about DNA methylation profiles in patients with latent HIV-1 or with an active infection?",
        "answer": "Research has shown that HIV-1 infection alters DNA methylation profiles in infected cells. In latent HIV-1 infection, DNA methylation plays a role in silencing viral transcription, helping to maintain latency. In active infection, changes in DNA methylation patterns can reactivate latent viruses and influence viral replication.\n\nStudies have identified specific differentially methylated regions (DMRs) associated with HIV-1 latency and reactivation. For example, methylation of the HIV-1 long terminal repeat (LTR) region is often associated with latency, while demethylation can lead to viral reactivation.\n\nAdditionally, HIV-1 infection can also alter the methylation profiles of host genes involved in immune response, cell signaling, and other cellular processes, which can impact disease progression and treatment outcomes.\n\nHowever, more research is needed to fully understand the complex interplay between DNA methylation, HIV-1 latency, and immune response.",
        "true_answer": "DNA methylation is correlated with and functionally linked to HIV-1 pathogenesis and latency. In active infection, HIV-1 infection is associated with global changes in host cell DNA methylation patterns, while in latent infection, methylation of the proviral DNA, particularly in the 5\u2019 LTR promoter and intragenic regions, plays a crucial role in maintaining viral latency."

        "question": "A 43-year-old man with HIV infection comes to the physician because of a 2-week history of progressive diarrhea and a 3-kg (6.6-lb) weight loss. During this period, he has had 3\u20134 episodes of watery stools daily, with multiple instances of blood in the stool. He is currently receiving antiretroviral therapy with zidovudine, lamivudine, and dolutegravir. Physical examination shows pallor and dry mucous membranes. A colonoscopy shows multiple linear ulcers. Polymerase chain reaction of a stool sample is positive for cytomegalovirus. Treatment with valganciclovir is begun. Adding this drug to his current medication regimen puts this patient at greatest risk for what specific adverse effects?",
        "answer": "The addition of valganciclovir to this patient's current regimen, which includes zidovudine, puts him at greatest risk for hematologic adverse effects, specifically neutropenia. Both valganciclovir and zidovudine can cause bone marrow suppression, leading to decreased neutrophil counts. This combination may increase the risk of neutropenia, which can predispose the patient to infections. Close monitoring of his complete blood count is necessary.",
        "true_answer": "Treatment with valganciclovir places the patient at increased risk for pancytopenia."

      {
        "question": "A 43-year-old man with HIV comes to the physician because of fever and night sweats over the past 15 days. During this period, he has also had headaches and generalized weakness. He has no cough or shortness of breath. He has hypertension controlled with lisinopril and is currently receiving triple antiretroviral therapy. He has smoked one pack of cigarettes daily for the past 15 years and drinks one to two beers on weekends. He is a known user of intravenous illicit drugs. His temperature is 39\u00b0C (102\u00b0F), pulse is 115/min, respirations are 15/min, and blood pressure is 130/80 mm Hg. Examination shows several track marks on the forearms. The lungs are clear to auscultation. A holosystolic murmur that increases on inspiration is heard along the left sternal border. The remainder of the physical examination shows no abnormalities. Laboratory studies show a leukocyte count of 12,800/mm3 and an erythrocyte sedimentation rate of 52 mm/h. His CD4+ T-lymphocyte count is 450/mm3 (normal \u2265 500). What is the most likely diagnosis and sequela of the condition?",
        "answer": "The patient's symptoms, such as fever, night sweats, and a new heart murmur, in the context of a history of intravenous drug use, suggest infective endocarditis (IE) as the most likely diagnosis. The presence of a holosystolic murmur that increases with inspiration (consistent with tricuspid regurgitation) and the patient's history of intravenous drug use support this diagnosis. The sequela of untreated or inadequately treated IE can be severe, including heart failure, septic emboli, and death. Given the patient's HIV status and the potential for complications, prompt diagnosis with blood cultures and echocardiography, followed by appropriate antibiotic therapy, is crucial.",
        "true_answer": "The most likely diagnosis in this patient is right-sided infective endocarditis. The patient is at high risk of developing septic pulmonary embolism as a sequela."

        "question": "A 55-year-old man is brought to the emergency department because of cough and poor appetite for the past week. Since it began, he has been coughing up small amounts of malodorous phlegm. During the past two nights, he has also had night sweats. He was diagnosed with HIV infection 5 years ago. He has hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and severe heartburn. The patient is homeless and does not take any medication. He has smoked a pack of cigarettes daily for 30 years. He drinks 8\u201310 beers daily. His temperature is 38.9\u00b0C (102.0\u00b0F), pulse is 101/min, respirations are 25/min, and blood pressure is 145/92 mm Hg. The patient appears intoxicated. Physical examination shows crackles and dullness to percussion at the right lung base. Scattered expiratory wheezing is heard throughout both lung fields. A grade 2/6 mid-systolic ejection murmur is heard along the upper right sternal border. His CD4+ T-lymphocyte count is 280/mm3 (Normal \u2265 500). An x-ray of the chest shows a hazy infiltrate in the right lower lung field. What is the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms?",
        "answer": "Given the patient's symptoms, physical examination findings, and radiographic results, the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms is a bacterial pneumonia, possibly due to a common pathogen such as Streptococcus pneumoniae. The patient's HIV status with a CD4 count of 280/mm^3, history of smoking, and alcohol use increase his susceptibility to infections, including pneumonia. The presence of crackles, dullness to percussion, and a hazy infiltrate on the chest x-ray support this diagnosis. However, it's also important to consider other opportunistic infections, such as Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP), given the patient's HIV status, although the clinical presentation and CD4 count might be less typical for PCP. Further diagnostic workup, including blood cultures and possibly sputum analysis, would be necessary to confirm the causative pathogen.",
        "true_answer": "Aspiration pneumonia is the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms."

        "question": "You are reviewing raw data from a research study performed at your medical center examining the effectiveness of a novel AIDS screening examination. The study enrolled 250 patients with confirmed AIDS, and 240 of these patients demonstrated a positive screening examination. The control arm of the study enrolled 250 patients who do not have AIDS, and only 5 of these patients tested positive on the novel screening examination. What is the NPV of this novel test?",
        "answer": "To calculate the Negative Predictive Value (NPV), we need to know the number of true negatives (TN) and false negatives (FN). \n\nTrue negatives are the patients without AIDS who test negative, which is 250 (control arm) - 5 (false positives) = 245.\n\nFalse negatives are the patients with AIDS who test negative, which is 250 (AIDS patients) - 240 (true positives) = 10.\n\nThe formula for NPV is: NPV = TN / (TN + FN)\n\nNPV = 245 / (245 + 10) = 245 / 255 \u2248 0.961 or 96.1%.\n\nSo, the NPV of this novel test is approximately 96.1%. This means that if the test is negative, there is a 96.1% chance that the patient does not have AIDS.",
        "true_answer": "The NPV of this test is calculated as the proportion of true negatives among all negative results, 245 / (245 + 10) = 0.96."

        "question": "A 39-year-old man comes to the emergency department because of increasing shortness of breath over the past 3 months. He has been unable to climb the 3 flights of stairs to his apartment. Six years ago, he was diagnosed with HIV. He is currently receiving triple antiretroviral therapy, but he says that he often misses doses. His temperature is 38.1\u00b0C (100.6\u00b0F), pulse is 90/min, respirations are 22/min, and blood pressure is 160/70 mm Hg. There is a grade 4/6 holodiastolic murmur heard best at the right sternal border. The pupils are 4 mm, round, and not reactive to light. When a pen tip is advanced closer to the face, the pupils constrict. Extraocular movements are intact. When asked to stand, hold his arms in front of him, and close his eyes, he loses his balance and takes a step backward. An x-ray of the chest shows widening of the mediastinum. What is the most likely diagnosis and therapy to reverse the patient\u2019s metabolic abnormalities?",
        "answer": "The patient's presentation suggests a complex clinical picture, but key findings point towards a diagnosis of tuberculous (TB) pericarditis or another form of pericarditis, given the shortness of breath, fever, and the holodiastolic murmur, which could indicate cardiac involvement. The widened mediastinum on chest X-ray could also suggest mediastinal lymphadenopathy, which is common in TB or lymphoma, both of which can be associated with HIV.\n\nHowever, the question about reversing the patient's metabolic abnormalities is somewhat unclear without specific details on what those abnormalities are. Given the context, it seems there might be an implication of adrenal insufficiency, suggested by the non-reactive pupils to light (which could be a misleading finding and might not directly relate to adrenal function) and the presence of hypotension or other systemic symptoms that are not fully detailed here.\n\nIf we consider the possibility of adrenal insufficiency, potentially due to disseminated TB affecting the adrenal glands (a known complication in immunocompromised patients), the therapy to reverse metabolic abnormalities would involve:\n\n1. **Corticosteroid replacement therapy** to address adrenal insufficiency, if confirmed.\n2. **Antitubercular therapy** if TB is confirmed, which would involve a combination of drugs such as isoniazid, rifampicin, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol.\n3. **Optimization of antiretroviral therapy** to improve the patient's immune status, which is crucial in managing opportunistic infections in HIV patients.\n\nIt's essential to note that the diagnosis and treatment plan should be tailored based on further diagnostic workup, including blood tests for adrenal function, TB testing (such as sputum smear, culture, or GeneXpert), and potentially imaging studies to assess for lymphadenopathy or other complications. The patient's non-adherence to antiretroviral therapy should also be addressed to prevent further immunocompromise.",
        "true_answer": "A Treponemal test is most likely to confirm the diagnosis."

        "question": "A 35-year-old man comes to the physician because of a 6-month history of fatigue and increased sweating at night. He says that he feels 'constantly tired' and needs more rest than usual although he sleeps well. In the morning, his sheets are often wet and his skin is clammy. He has not had any sore throat, runny nose, or cough recently. He has not traveled anywhere. Over the past 4 months, he has had a 6.8-kg (15-lb) weight loss, despite having a normal appetite. He does not drink or urinate more than usual. He is 181 cm (5 ft 11 in) tall and weighs 72 kg (159 lb); BMI is 22 kg/m2. His temperature is 37.9\u00b0C (100.2\u00b0F), pulse is 65/min, and blood pressure is 120/70 mmHg. Physical examination shows no abnormalities. An HIV screening test and confirmatory test are both positive. The CD4 count is 600 cells/\u03bcl and the viral load is 104 copies/mL. Treatment with lamivudine, zidovudine, and indinavir is begun. The patient is at greatest risk for what adverse effects? ",
        "answer": "The patient is at greatest risk for adverse effects related to the medications, particularly:\n\n1. **Lactic acidosis and hepatotoxicity** with lamivudine and zidovudine (nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors).\n2. **Nephrolithiasis (kidney stones)** and **hyperbilirubinemia** with indinavir (protease inhibitor).\n3. **Lipodystrophy** and **metabolic changes** with the combination of these medications, particularly the protease inhibitor indinavir.\n\nIt's also important to note that the patient's viral load is relatively low and the CD4 count is high, which may indicate that the patient is in the early stages of HIV infection. Close monitoring of the patient's response to treatment and potential side effects is crucial.",
        "true_answer": "The patient is at greatest risk for developing urolithiasis as an adverse effect."

The abdomen is soft, and there is diffuse tenderness to palpation with no guarding or rebound. Bowel sounds are hyperactive. Microscopy of a modified acid-fast stain on a stool sample reveals oocysts. What is the most likely causal organism?",
        "answer": "Based on the patient's symptoms, travel history, and laboratory findings, the most likely causal organism is Cryptosporidium. The presence of oocysts on a modified acid-fast stain of a stool sample is diagnostic for cryptosporidiosis, which is a common opportunistic infection in immunocompromised patients, particularly those with low CD4+ T-lymphocyte counts like this patient.",

        "question": "A 48-year-old woman is brought to her primary care physician by her sister who is concerned about a deterioration in the patient\u2019s general status. The patient was diagnosed with HIV 7 years ago. She says that her last T cell count was \"good enough\", so she has been skipping every other dose of her antiretroviral medications and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Her sister has had to drive her home from work several times this month because she has become disoriented and confused about her surroundings. Motor strength is 4/5 on the right and 3/5 on the left. She is able to walk unassisted, but her gait appears mildly uncoordinated. There is diplopia when the right eye is covered. Her CD4 count is 75 cells/\u00b5L. MRI shows numerous asymmetric, hyperintense, non-enhancing lesions bilaterally without mass effect. Brain biopsy shows demyelination and atypical astrocytes. What is most likely responsible for this patient's current condition?",
        "answer": "Based on the patient's symptoms, low CD4 count, and brain biopsy results, the most likely cause of her current condition is Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy (PML). PML is a rare and opportunistic infection caused by the JC virus, which typically affects individuals with severely compromised immune systems, such as those with advanced HIV infection. The brain biopsy findings of demyelination and atypical astrocytes are consistent with PML. The patient's non-adherence to antiretroviral therapy, resulting in a low CD4 count, has likely increased her risk of developing this condition.",

A lumbar puncture with subsequent cerebrospinal fluid analysis shows slight pleocytosis, and PCR is positive for Epstein-Barr virus DNA. What is the most likely diagnosis?",
        "answer": "Based on the patient's history of HIV, inconsistent adherence to antiretroviral therapy, low CD4+ T-lymphocyte count, and the presence of a ring-enhancing lesion on the MRI, the most likely diagnosis is Primary Central Nervous System Lymphoma (PCNSL). The presence of Epstein-Barr virus DNA in the cerebrospinal fluid supports this diagnosis, as PCNSL is often associated with EBV in immunocompromised patients. However, toxoplasmosis and other opportunistic infections should also be considered in the differential diagnosis.

His temperature is 37\u00b0C (98.6\u00b0F), respiratory rate is 15/min, pulse is 70/min, and blood pressure is 100/84 mm Hg. A physical examination is performed which is within normal limits. His blood tests results are given below:\n\nHb%: 11 gm/dL\nTotal count (WBC): 3,400 /mm3\nDifferential count:\nNeutrophils: 70%\nLymphocytes: 25%\nMonocytes: 5%\nCD4+ cell count: 88/mm3\n\nStool microscopy results are pending. What is the most likely diagnosis?",
        "answer": "Given the patient's symptoms of watery diarrhea, right upper quadrant pain, fever, malaise, nausea, and anorexia, along with his HIV-positive status and non-compliance with antiretroviral therapy (ART), the clinical presentation suggests an opportunistic infection. The low CD4+ cell count (88/mm3) indicates a compromised immune system, making him susceptible to various opportunistic infections.\n\nThe most likely diagnosis, considering the gastrointestinal symptoms and the patient's immunocompromised state, could be an opportunistic infection such as cryptosporidiosis or microsporidiosis, which are known to cause watery diarrhea in HIV-positive individuals with low CD4+ counts. However, without the stool microscopy results, it's challenging to pinpoint the exact cause. Other possibilities could include infections like giardiasis or bacterial infections such as Salmonella or Shigella, though the latter typically present with more systemic symptoms and a higher fever.\n\nGiven the patient's non-compliance with ART, re-initiation or adjustment of antiretroviral therapy, along with treatment for the opportunistic infection once identified, would be crucial. Empirical treatment may be considered based on clinical judgment while awaiting diagnostic results.",
        "true_answer": "Cryptosporidiosis is the most likely diagnosis."

        "question": "A 38-year-old man comes to the physician because of fever, malaise, productive cough, and left-sided chest pain for 2 weeks. During this time, he has woken up to a wet pillow in the morning on multiple occasions and has not been as hungry as usual. He was diagnosed with HIV infection 1 year ago. He currently stays at a homeless shelter. He has smoked one pack of cigarettes daily for 22 years. He has a history of intravenous illicit drug use. He drinks 5\u20136 beers daily. He is receiving combined antiretroviral therapy but sometimes misses doses. His temperature is 38.6\u00b0C (101.5\u00b0F), pulse is 106/min, and blood pressure is 125/85 mm Hg. Pulse oximetry on room air shows an oxygen saturation of 94%. Auscultation shows decreased breath sounds over the left base of the lung. There is dullness to percussion on the left lower part of the chest. Laboratory studies show:\n\nHemoglobin 14 g/dL\nLeukocyte count 5,000/mm3\nCD4+ T lymphocytes 240/mm3 (N > 500)\n\nSerum:\nCreatinine 0.9 mg/dL\n\u03b3-Glutamyltransferase (GGT) 65 U/L (N = 5\u201350)\nAspartate aminotransferase (AST) 15 U/L\nAlanine aminotransferase (ALT) 19 U/L\nAlkaline phosphatase 40 U/L\nLactate dehydrogenase (LDH) 50 U/L\n\nAn x-ray of the chest shows a left-sided pleural effusion and hilar lymphadenopathy. Analysis of the pleural fluid shows an effusion with lymphocyte-predominant leukocytosis, high protein, an LDH of 500 U/L, and high adenosine deaminase. What is the most likely cause of this patient's condition?",
        "answer": "Based on the patient's symptoms, laboratory results, and imaging findings, the most likely cause of his condition is tuberculosis (TB). The key findings that support this diagnosis include:\n\n* Lymphocyte-predominant pleural effusion with high protein and LDH\n* High adenosine deaminase (ADA) in the pleural fluid, which is a sensitive marker for TB\n* Hilar lymphadenopathy on chest x-ray\n* Patient's HIV status with a low CD4 count, which increases the risk of TB\n* The patient's symptoms, such as fever, night sweats, and weight loss, are also consistent with TB.\n\nIt's worth noting that the patient's history of intravenous drug use and living in a homeless shelter also increases his risk of TB exposure.",

        "question": "A 33-year-old HIV-positive male is seen in clinic for follow-up care. When asked if he has been adhering to his HIV medications, the patient exclaims that he has been depressed, thus causing him to not take his medication for six months. His CD4+ count is now 33 cells/mm3. What medication(s) should he take in addition to his anti-retroviral therapy? ",
        "answer": "Given the patient's history of depression and non-adherence to HIV medication, it's crucial to address both the depression and the potential for opportunistic infections due to the low CD4+ count.\n\nFor the depression, I would recommend starting an antidepressant. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are commonly used and generally safe in patients with HIV. Examples include fluoxetine, sertraline, or escitalopram.\n\nGiven the patient's low CD4+ count (33 cells/mm3), prophylaxis against opportunistic infections should be considered. Specifically, prophylaxis for Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP) with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) is recommended for patients with a CD4+ count below 200 cells/mm3. Additionally, considering the patient's immune status, prophylaxis for toxoplasmosis and possibly other opportunistic infections may be necessary, but this would depend on further evaluation and specific risk factors.\n\nIt's also essential to restart or adjust the patient's antiretroviral therapy (ART) as soon as possible to improve his CD4+ count and viral suppression. This should be done under the guidance of an HIV specialist, considering the potential for drug resistance due to the patient's history of non-adherence.",
        "true_answer": "In addition to his antiretroviral therapy, the patient should take azithromycin and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole to prevent opportunistic infections."

        "question": "A 35-year-old man comes to the physician because of progressive swelling of his legs over the past 2 months. During this period, the patient has had an unintentional 5-kg (11-lb) weight gain. He also reports frequent numbness of the tips of his fingers and cramping in his back and leg muscles. He has a history of HIV infection treated with combined antiretroviral therapy. The patient immigrated to the US from Nigeria 3 years ago. His temperature is 37\u00b0C (98.6\u00b0F), pulse is 80/min, and blood pressure 150/90 mm Hg. Physical examination shows 3+ periorbital and lower extremity edema bilaterally. Sensation to pinprick and light touch is decreased around the mouth and along the fingers. Laboratory studies show:\n\nSerum:\nAlbumin 2.5 g/dL\nTotal cholesterol 270 mg/dL\nHIV antibody positive\n\nUrine:\nBlood negative\nProtein +4\nRBC 1-2/hpf\nRBC casts negative\n\n What are the most likely findings of a kidney biopsy under light microscopy?",
        "answer": "Based on the patient's symptoms and laboratory results, the most likely diagnosis is Focal Segmental Glomerulosclerosis (FSGS), which is a common cause of nephrotic syndrome in HIV-infected patients, particularly those of African descent.\n\nUnder light microscopy, a kidney biopsy would likely show:\n\n* Focal segmental scarring of glomeruli, with some glomeruli appearing normal\n* Segmental sclerosis, characterized by increased matrix and collagen deposition, and obliteration of capillary lumens\n* Foot process effacement on electron microscopy (although this is not specifically asked, it's a characteristic feature of FSGS)\n\nThese findings are consistent with HIV-associated nephropathy (HIVAN), a condition that can lead to rapid progression to end-stage renal disease if left untreated.",

        "question": "A 46-year-old Caucasian male with past medical history of HIV (CD4: 77/mm^3), hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and osteoarthritis presents to the emergency department with sudden weakness of his right hand. He reports that the weakness has gradually been getting worse and that this morning he dropped his cup of coffee. He has never had anything like this happen to him before, although he was hospitalized last year for pneumonia. He reports inconsistent adherence to his home medications, which include raltegravir, tenofovir, emtricitabine, TMP-SMX, hydrochlorothiazide, pravastatin, and occasional ibuprofen. His father died of a myocardial infarction at the age of 60, and his mother suffered a stroke at the age of 72. The patient's temperature is 102.6\u00b0F (39.2\u00b0C), blood pressure is 156/92 mmHg, pulse is 88/min, and respirations are 18/min. On neurological exam, he has 3/5 strength in the distal muscles of the right extremity with preserved sensation. His neurological exam is normal in all other extremities. What is the next best step in management for this patient?",
        "answer": "Given the patient's symptoms of sudden weakness in one hand, fever, and history of HIV with a low CD4 count, the primary concern is an opportunistic infection or a neurological complication related to HIV, such as progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), toxoplasmosis, or a CNS lymphoma, but also considering stroke given the family history and the patient's vascular risk factors.\n\nThe next best step in management would be to immediately order imaging of the brain, preferably an MRI, to evaluate for these potential causes. Additionally, given the fever and potential for an infectious cause, blood cultures, and possibly a lumbar puncture (if not contraindicated by the imaging findings) should be considered to evaluate for CNS infections. It's also crucial to assess the patient's current HIV viral load and to review his adherence to antiretroviral therapy (ART), as improving adherence or adjusting his ART regimen may be necessary. \n\nGiven the acute presentation, the patient should be admitted to the hospital for further evaluation and management. Neurology consultation would be beneficial to guide further diagnostic workup and treatment.",

        "question": "A 37-year-old African-American man presents to his primary care provider with a history of fatigue and nausea that started about 6 months ago. His symptoms have slowly gotten worse and now he has trouble climbing the stairs to his 3rd floor apartment without resting. Past medical history is significant for poorly controlled HIV and a remote history of heroin addiction. Today his temperature is 36.9\u00b0C (98.4\u00b0F), the blood pressure is 118/72 mm Hg, and the pulse is 75/min. Physical examination reveals morbid obesity and 1+ pitting edema of both lower extremities. Urine dipstick reveals 2+ proteinuria. Urinalysis shows no abnormal findings. What is the most likely etiology of this patient condition?",
        "answer": "Given the patient's history of poorly controlled HIV, morbid obesity, and proteinuria, the most likely etiology of his condition is HIV-associated nephropathy (HIVAN). HIVAN is a common cause of chronic kidney disease in HIV-positive patients, particularly those of African descent. The presence of proteinuria and edema supports this diagnosis. However, further evaluation, including renal ultrasound and potentially a biopsy, would be necessary to confirm the diagnosis and rule out other causes of kidney disease, such as diabetic nephropathy or hypertensive nephrosclerosis.",
