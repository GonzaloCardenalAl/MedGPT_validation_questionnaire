    "question": "A 48-year-old woman is brought to her primary care physician by her sister who is concerned about a deterioration in the patient\u2019s general status. The patient was diagnosed with HIV 7 years ago. She says that her last T cell count was \"good enough\", so she has been skipping every other dose of her antiretroviral medications and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Her sister has had to drive her home from work several times this month because she has become disoriented and confused about her surroundings. Motor strength is 4/5 on the right and 3/5 on the left. She is able to walk unassisted, but her gait appears mildly uncoordinated. There is diplopia when the right eye is covered. Her CD4 count is 75 cells/\u00b5L. MRI shows numerous asymmetric, hyperintense, non-enhancing lesions bilaterally without mass effect. Brain biopsy shows demyelination and atypical astrocytes. What is most likely responsible for this patient's current condition?",
    "answer": "Based on the patient's symptoms, low CD4 count, and brain biopsy results, the most likely cause of her current condition is Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy (PML). PML is a rare and opportunistic infection caused by the JC virus, which typically affects individuals with severely compromised immune systems, such as those with advanced HIV infection. The brain biopsy findings of demyelination and atypical astrocytes are consistent with PML. The patient's non-adherence to antiretroviral therapy, resulting in a low CD4 count, has likely increased her risk of developing this condition.",
    "true_answer": "John Cunningham virus (JC virus) is most likely responsible for this patient's current condition."

    "question": "A 52-year-old man is brought to the emergency department because of headaches, vertigo, and changes to his personality for the past few weeks. He was diagnosed with HIV 14 years ago and was started on antiretroviral therapy at that time. Medical records from one month ago indicate that he followed his medication schedule inconsistently. Since then, he has been regularly taking his antiretroviral medications and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. His vital signs are within normal limits. Neurological examination shows ataxia and apathy. Mini-Mental State Examination score is 15/30. Laboratory studies show: Hemoglobin 12.5 g/dL Leukocyte count 8400/mm3 Segmented neutrophils 80% Eosinophils 1% Lymphocytes 17% Monocytes 2% CD4+ T-lymphocytes 90/\u03bcL Platelet count 328,000/mm3 An MRI of the brain with contrast shows a solitary ring-enhancing lesion involving the corpus callosum and measuring 4.5 cm in diameter. A lumbar puncture with subsequent cerebrospinal fluid analysis shows slight pleocytosis, and PCR is positive for Epstein-Barr virus DNA. What is the most likely diagnosis?",
    "answer": "Based on the patient's history of HIV, inconsistent adherence to antiretroviral therapy, low CD4+ T-lymphocyte count, and the presence of a ring-enhancing lesion on the MRI, the most likely diagnosis is Primary Central Nervous System Lymphoma (PCNSL). The presence of Epstein-Barr virus DNA in the cerebrospinal fluid supports this diagnosis, as PCNSL is often associated with EBV in immunocompromised patients. However, toxoplasmosis and other opportunistic infections should also be considered in the differential diagnosis. Further evaluation, such as a brain biopsy, may be necessary to confirm the diagnosis.",
    "true_answer": "The most likely diagnosis is CNS lymphoma."

    "question": "A 35-year-old man comes to the emergency department with fever, chills, dyspnea, and a productive cough. His symptoms began suddenly 2 days ago. He was diagnosed with HIV 4 years ago and has been on triple antiretroviral therapy since then. He smokes one pack of cigarettes daily. He is 181 cm (5 ft 11 in) tall and weighs 70 kg (154 lb); BMI is 21.4 kg/m\u00b2. He lives in Illinois and works as a carpenter. His temperature is 38.8\u00b0C (101.8\u00b0F), pulse is 110/min, respirations are 24/min, and blood pressure is 105/74 mm Hg. Pulse oximetry on room air shows an oxygen saturation of 92%. Examination reveals crackles over the right lower lung base.

    "question": "A 48-year-old man presents to the clinic with several weeks of watery diarrhea and right upper quadrant pain with fever. He also endorses malaise, nausea, and anorexia. He is HIV-positive and is currently on antiretroviral therapy. He admits to not being compliant with his current medications. His temperature is 37\u00b0C (98.6\u00b0F), respiratory rate is 15/min, pulse is 70/min, and blood pressure is 100/84 mm Hg. A physical examination is performed which is within normal limits. His blood tests results are given below:\n\nHb%: 11 gm/dL\nTotal count (WBC): 3,400 /mm3\nDifferential count:\nNeutrophils: 70%\nLymphocytes: 25%\nMonocytes: 5%\nCD4+ cell count: 88/mm3\n\nStool microscopy results are pending. What is the most likely diagnosis?",
    "answer": "Given the patient's symptoms of watery diarrhea, right upper quadrant pain, fever, malaise, nausea, and anorexia, along with his HIV-positive status and non-compliance with antiretroviral therapy (ART), the clinical presentation suggests an opportunistic infection. The low CD4+ cell count (88/mm3) indicates a compromised immune system, making him susceptible to various opportunistic infections.\n\nThe most likely diagnosis, considering the gastrointestinal symptoms and the patient's immunocompromised state, could be an opportunistic infection such as cryptosporidiosis or microsporidiosis, which are known to cause watery diarrhea in HIV-positive individuals with low CD4+ counts. However, without the stool microscopy results, it's challenging to pinpoint the exact cause. Other possibilities could include infections like giardiasis or bacterial infections such as Salmonella or Shigella, though the latter typically present with more systemic symptoms and a higher fever.\n\nGiven the patient's non-compliance with ART, re-initiation or adjustment of antiretroviral therapy, along with treatment for the opportunistic infection once identified, would be crucial. Empirical treatment may be considered based on clinical judgment while awaiting diagnostic results.",
    "true_answer": "Cryptosporidiosis is the most likely diagnosis."

    "question": "A 38-year-old man comes to the physician because of fever, malaise, productive cough, and left-sided chest pain for 2 weeks. During this time, he has woken up to a wet pillow in the morning on multiple occasions and has not been as hungry as usual. He was diagnosed with HIV infection 1 year ago. He currently stays at a homeless shelter. He has smoked one pack of cigarettes daily for 22 years. He has a history of intravenous illicit drug use. He drinks 5\u20136 beers daily. He is receiving combined antiretroviral therapy but sometimes misses doses. His temperature is 38.6\u00b0C (101.5\u00b0F), pulse is 106/min, and blood pressure is 125/85 mm Hg. Pulse oximetry on room air shows an oxygen saturation of 94%. Auscultation shows decreased breath sounds over the left base of the lung. There is dullness to percussion on the left lower part of the chest.

    "question": "A 33-year-old HIV-positive male is seen in clinic for follow-up care. When asked if he has been adhering to his HIV medications, the patient exclaims that he has been depressed, thus causing him to not take his medication for six months. His CD4+ count is now 33 cells/mm3. What medication(s) should he take in addition to his anti-retroviral therapy? ",
    "answer": "Given the patient's history of depression and non-adherence to HIV medication, it's crucial to address both the depression and the potential for opportunistic infections due to the low CD4+ count.\n\nFor the depression, I would recommend starting an antidepressant. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are commonly used and generally safe in patients with HIV. Examples include fluoxetine, sertraline, or escitalopram.\n\nGiven the patient's low CD4+ count (33 cells/mm3), prophylaxis against opportunistic infections should be considered. Specifically, prophylaxis for Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP) with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) is recommended for patients with a CD4+ count below 200 cells/mm3. Additionally, considering the patient's immune status, prophylaxis for toxoplasmosis and possibly other opportunistic infections may be necessary, but this would depend on further evaluation and specific risk factors.\n\nIt's also essential to restart or adjust the patient's antiretroviral therapy (ART) as soon as possible to improve his CD4+ count and viral suppression. This should be done under the guidance of an HIV specialist, considering the potential for drug resistance due to the patient's history of non-adherence.",
    "true_answer": "In addition to his antiretroviral therapy, the patient should take azithromycin and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole to prevent opportunistic infections."

    "question": "A 35-year-old man comes to the physician because of progressive swelling of his legs over the past 2 months. During this period, the patient has had an unintentional 5-kg (11-lb) weight gain. He also reports frequent numbness of the tips of his fingers and cramping in his back and leg muscles. He has a history of HIV infection treated with combined antiretroviral therapy. The patient immigrated to the US from Nigeria 3 years ago. His temperature is 37\u00b0C (98.6\u00b0F), pulse is 80/min, and blood pressure 150/90 mm Hg. Physical examination shows 3+ periorbital and lower extremity edema bilaterally. Sensation to pinprick and light touch is decreased around the mouth and along the fingers. Laboratory studies show:\n\nSerum:\nAlbumin 2.5 g/dL\nTotal cholesterol 270 mg/dL\nHIV antibody positive\n\nUrine:\nBlood negative\nProtein +4\nRBC 1-2/hpf\nRBC casts negative\n\n What are the most likely findings of a kidney biopsy under light microscopy?",
    "answer": "Based on the patient's symptoms and laboratory results, the most likely diagnosis is Focal Segmental Glomerulosclerosis (FSGS), which is a common cause of nephrotic syndrome in HIV-infected patients, particularly those of African descent.\n\nUnder light microscopy, a kidney biopsy would likely show:\n\n* Focal segmental scarring of glomeruli, with some glomeruli appearing normal\n* Segmental sclerosis, characterized by increased matrix and collagen deposition, and obliteration of capillary lumens\n* Foot process effacement on electron microscopy (although this is not specifically asked, it's a characteristic feature of FSGS)\n\nThese findings are consistent with HIV-associated nephropathy (HIVAN), a condition that can lead to rapid progression to end-stage renal disease if left untreated.",

    "question": "A 46-year-old Caucasian male with past medical history of HIV (CD4: 77/mm^3), hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and osteoarthritis presents to the emergency department with sudden weakness of his right hand. He reports that the weakness has gradually been getting worse and that this morning he dropped his cup of coffee. He has never had anything like this happen to him before, although he was hospitalized last year for pneumonia. He reports inconsistent adherence to his home medications, which include raltegravir, tenofovir, emtricitabine, TMP-SMX, hydrochlorothiazide, pravastatin, and occasional ibuprofen. His father died of a myocardial infarction at the age of 60, and his mother suffered a stroke at the age of 72. The patient's temperature is 102.6\u00b0F (39.2\u00b0C), blood pressure is 156/92 mmHg, pulse is 88/min, and respirations are 18/min. On neurological exam, he has 3/5 strength in the distal muscles of the right extremity with preserved sensation. His neurological exam is normal in all other extremities. What is the next best step in management for this patient?",
    "answer": "Given the patient's symptoms of sudden weakness in one hand, fever, and history of HIV with a low CD4 count, the primary concern is an opportunistic infection or a neurological complication related to HIV, such as progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), toxoplasmosis, or a CNS lymphoma, but also considering stroke given the family history and the patient's vascular risk factors.\n\nThe next best step in management would be to immediately order imaging of the brain, preferably an MRI, to evaluate for these potential causes. Additionally, given the fever and potential for an infectious cause, blood cultures, and possibly a lumbar puncture (if not contraindicated by the imaging findings) should be considered to evaluate for CNS infections. It's also crucial to assess the patient's current HIV viral load and to review his adherence to antiretroviral therapy (ART), as improving adherence or adjusting his ART regimen may be necessary. \n\nGiven the acute presentation, the patient should be admitted to the hospital for further evaluation and management. Neurology consultation would be beneficial to guide further diagnostic workup and treatment.",
